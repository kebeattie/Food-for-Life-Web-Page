          <header><h1>Introduction</h1></header>
          <p>This page is an attempt to summarise the key diet advice from Tim Spector's 2022 book "Food for Life". The book draws on cutting edge research and personal insights from Professor Spector in an attempt to help us choose what to eat, and what to avoid. Subtitled "Your Guide to the New Science of Eating Well", the book goes in depth on a range of health and food related topics, including:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>What is the gut microbiome?</li>
              <li>Why do we love food?</li>
              <li>What foods are really healthy/unhealthy?</li>
              <li>How can foods effect us as unique individuals?</li>
              <li>How do our food choices impact the enviroment?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Professor Spector also breaks down different types of foods and explains which we should seek/avoid.</p>
            <p>Of course, if you're really interested in this, you should read the book for yourself! But if you don't have the time for a 400 page read, then I'll do my best to sum up Professor Spector's diet advice!</p>

          <p><h3>Polyphenols</h3></p>
          <p>Polyphenols are a vitally important group of plant chemicals that only our gut microbes can utilise. Essentially, polyphenols are plant chemicals created to protect against environmental or predator attacks. Foods vary massively in the quantities of polyphenols they contain, with different coloured vegetables of the same type varying up to tenfold! This is part of why it's important to vary the colours of the plants we eat. So why do we need polyphenols?</p>
          <p>Polyphenols help protect your body by:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Improving heart health</li>
              <li>Lowering diabetes risk</li>
              <li>Raising immunity</li>
              <li>Potentially lowering cancer risks</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p><h3>Vitamins and Minerals</h3></p>
          <p>Our body needs vitamins and minerals to perform properly and stay healthy. These vitamins and minerals are found in different foods in varying qualities, just like polyhenols, in foods of different colours. Of course, we all know about vitamins and minerals these days so I won't go into detail, but to make sure we get enough of them it's important to "eat the rainbow"!</p>
          <p><h3>Rainbow Diet Table</h3></p>
          <p>The following table shows Tim Spector's tips for vegetables and legumes catagorised by colour to increase vitamin, mineral, and polyphenol diversity in our diets.</p>

          <header><h1>Ultra Processed Foods (UPFs)</h1></header>
          <p><h3>What are UPFs?</h3></p>
          <p>UPFs contain mixtures of fat, salt and sugar in quantities that have been tested on human volunteers to produce the perfect bliss point which lights up the pleasure centres. The brain, once tricked, then produces feel-good neurochemicals like dopamine which override any signals of fullness from our gut hormones or even our microbes. These three key flavours (sugar, fat and salt), with the addition of a 'crunchy' mouthfeel, are used to convert cheap, tasteless and nutritionally useless base ingredients into addictive foods. Recent additions of flavour enhancers, artificial sweetners, sugar alcohols and other new "wonder" chemicals are designed to increase this brain response and further disrupt our normal feedback loops of satiety. No foods in nature possess this heady, addictive mix, so we lack any evolutionary defence mechanism to stop us gouging on them. As a result, we are becoming fatter but less nourished, which is especially a problem for our children who are now growing up eating UPFs.</p>
          <p><h3>Minimally Processed Food vs UPF table</h3></p>
          <p>The following table shows examples of foods in their minamilly processed, processed and UPF forms. When choosing food, we should aim to have the majority of it in its whole form, sometimes in its processed form and very occasionally in its UPF form. Currently most of our calories are in the UPF form.</p>

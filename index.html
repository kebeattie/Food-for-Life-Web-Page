          <p>This page is an attempt to summarise the key diet advice from Tim Spector's 2022 book "Food for Life". The book draws on cutting edge research and personal insights from Professor Spector in an attempt to help us choose what to eat, and what to avoid. Subtitled "Your Guide to the New Science of Eating Well", the book goes in depth on a range of health and food related topics, including:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>What is the microbiome?</li>
              <li>Why do we love food?</li>
              <li>What foods are really healthy/unhealthy?</li>
              <li>How can foods effect us as unique individuals?</li>
              <li>How do our food choices impact the enviroment?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Professor Spector also breaks down different types of foods and explains which we should seek/avoid.</p>
            <p>Of course, if you're really interested in this, you should read the book for yourself! But if you don't have the time for a 400 page read, then I'll do my best to sum up Professor Spector's diet advice!</p>

          <p><h3>Polyphenols</h3></p>
          <p>Polyphenols are a vitally important group of plant chemicals that only our gut microbes can utilise. Essentially, polyphenols are plant chemicals created to protect against environmental or predator attacks. Foods vary massively in the quantities of polyphenols they contain, with different coloured vegetables of the same type varying up to tenfold! This is part of why it's important to vary the colours of the plants we eat. So why do we need polyphenols?</p>
          <p>Polyphenols help protect your body by:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Improving heart health</li>
              <li>Lowering diabetes risk</li>
              <li>Raising immunity</li>
              <li>Potentially lowering cancer risks</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p><h3>Vitamins and Minerals</h3></p>
          <p>Our body needs vitamins and minerals to perform properly and stay healthy. These vitamins and minerals are found in different foods in varying qualities, just like polyhenols, in foods of different colours. Of course, we all know about vitamins and minerals these days so I won't go into detail, but to make sure we get enough of them it's important to "eat the rainbow"!</p>
          <p><h3>Rainbow Diet Table</h3></p>
          <p>The following table shows Tim Spector's tips for vegetables and legumes catagorised by colour to increase vitamin, mineral, and polyphenol diversity in our diets.</p>
